* Background

- Web applications are supplanting desktop applications in many cases
- Web tech is intrinsically portable, and for many users is the new 'native'
- Complex layout capabilities are first class
- Separation of code and presentation has existed for nearly two decades
- Local applications will continue to be important in a variety of roles

* Enter lwa

  func Serve(handler http.Handler) error

- Serves http on a random localhost port
- Spawns an app-style browser window pointing at that port
- Only requests originating from the app window are permitted
- Serve returns with nil error when app window is closed

* Demo

- Didn't have time for a demo
- But it's just like the web, except locally hosted!

* Followup thoughts

- Embedded databases are fun and applicable here
- Usually single-file; no client/server model
- File based permission system (e.g. 0600)
- Packaging files into the binary -- appending a zip container is one approach
